Question 1
-----------
1.Create a sample class named Employee with four attributes : id / name / age / gender

    employee :

        id
        name
        age
        gender

    Create an object of this class and create a function called display() to display the information of the object you created

Question 2
-----------

2.Recreate the class named Employee. Two objects will be created and displayed, but object information will be retrieved from the user.
Then calculate the salary using the formula below.

        salary = 2100 * (Age - 18)

        This will calculate the user's total salary to date

        If the employee is more than 40 years old, a bonus of $4000 will be given to their total salary !
