We have the following information about the products in the market :

        ------------------------

       1.Create a product and stock dictionary using the above
       2.Write a program that asks user for three type of inputs
                   a. "show" : If user enter show then it should print all products with their stock values in this format.

                   b. "add"  : If user input add then it should further ask for a product name to add. If product
                   already exist in our dataset then it should print that it exist and do nothing. If it doesn't then it
                   asks for stock value and add that new product/stock in our dictionary and print it.

                   c. "Remove" : When user inputs remove it should ask for a product name to remove. If product exist in
                   our dictionary then remove it and print new dictionary using format shown above in (a). Else print
                   that product doesn't exist!

You should get these values in your main program by calling circle_calc function and then print them
